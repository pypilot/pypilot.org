I finally got the boat out of the marina and tried out the PyPilot.
After correcting the motor polarity and making some gain adjustments, it
performed remarkably well.  It could hold a route to within 0.02NM up a
river with winds varying from 0 to 18kts and strong variable currents.



Hi Sean -

Just to let you know about our early experiences with the pypilot system. I had a 600 mile trip planned and the idea was to have pypilot as a backup. My old Raymarine system thought otherwise and basically died the week before setting sail. I wasn't really prepared, with just a couple of hours to learn and set up Pypilot on the boat.

It basically "just worked" with the Raymarine motor of the old system. Energy efficient, no problems staying on course most of the time. Really wonderful. We had some problems and on moderate winds, on a reach or downwind, the alarm would go off  and the system would stall. Just on occasion, though, I am pretty sure that more configuration/calibration could sort that out.

Really, really happy about the product.  Thank you for all your great work! It did around 90% or more of the steering along the 600 miles (we were double handed). 

All the best, and thank you again!




Hello Sean,

I want to say: thank you very much for the controller and also for the pypilot software! Everything is working really great!
Its installed with the motor of the old Raymarine ST 3000. Software is openplotter.
I sailed this summer with my Hallberg Rassy HR38 from the north of Croatia to Italy, around Malta and back - more then 3.000 nm. In every situation, the pypilot did a really, really great job!
So - thank you for this!

"Just a quick note to say Iâ€™m really enjoying have my Pypilot operational. Steering my 30 ton ketch Baraka Bashad along at 7.2 knots"


So I have a very functional device for my Misil II and use it at the Elbe and Nord Sea.
